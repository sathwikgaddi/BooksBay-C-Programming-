Description:
                   ->This is a simple book renting application.
                     ->This application consists of two phases client and customer.
                     ->If  a user logins as a client he will have 3 options 1.add books for rent.
                         2.edit cost of rent of already existing books.
                         3.delete the books from application.
                   ->If a user logins as a customer he will have 4 options 1.rent a book after viewing all books in application.
                                 2.rent a book by searching for a particular book.
                                 3.view your status i.e, all the books you rented.
                                 4.return a book.

                   ->When a client adds a book in the application he also adds a particular cost for the book.
                 ->when a customer returns a book the application views a bill receipt of amount to be paid.

Processing:
                 ->The aboved concept was designed using files and structures.
                ->we used 3 different files.
                           1.for books in application.
                           2.for all the books rented.
                           3.for user details.
            ->we also used 3 different structures.
                           1.for books in application.
                           2.for all the books rented.
                           3.for user details.

         ->When a client adds book the name of book and its cost are stored along with its stock available in the file.
        ->When a customer rents a book the username of customer, book name and the date he rented the book is stored in the file.
      ->When the customer returns the book based on the date he rented the book and returned the bill will be calculated and viewed.
